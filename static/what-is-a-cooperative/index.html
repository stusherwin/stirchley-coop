      <h1 class="">What is a co-operative?</h1>
      <img src="/img/coop-marque2.png" class="main" />
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity">International Co-operative Alliance</a>,</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A co-operative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically controlled enterprise.</p></blockquote>

<p>Co-operatives are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity. In the tradition of their founders, co-operative members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others. Co-operatives also follow the <a href="https://www.uk.coop/the-hive/is-a-co-op-right-for-you/getting-started/co-op-movement/values-principles">seven Co-operative Principles</a>.</p>

<p>As we are a co-operative, each one of our tenants will have an equal say in the running of the building in which they live or work. We are a non-profit organisation, so any profits will be reinvested as the members see fit. We wish to support and grow other co-operatives in the community by providing them with secure and affordable premises.</p>
