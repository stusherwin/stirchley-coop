      <h1 class="">About us</h1>
      <img src="img/stirchley.png" class="" />
      <p>We are a group of people who have been working to create <i>co-operative</i> development in-and-around Stirchley for the past decade. We are looking for a place for some of us to call home and others to work from - and maybe some of us both! Stirchley <i>Co-operative</i> Development is a community organisation focused on building co-operation in Stirchley, with the aim of giving the people of Stirchley more control over their home and work environments. In order to achieve this we needed to think big. </p>
      <p>We are a <i>co-operative</i>, which means that each one of our tenants has an equal vote in the running of the building in which they live or work. We are not-for-profit, so that any surplus is reinvested as the members see fit. As a <i>co-operative</i> we wish to support and grow other <i>co-operatives</i> in the community by providing them with secure and affordable premises.</p>
      <p>We aim to build to a high standard, with an emphasis on creating a low energy design in order to have a small environmental footprint and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2e) whilst retaining high thermal comfort. Low energy bills will help to keep running costs low for tenants. We also have a strong emphasis on community cohesion, as our buildings incorporate plenty of space for members of the community to meet and interact; as the operation of the building is run collectively, residents are encouraged to take an active role in the day-to-day management of their environment.</p>
      <p>We have created Stirchley <i>Co-operative</i> Development Limited, a multi-stakeholder <i>co-operative</i> of residents, tenants and investors:</p>
      <ul class="mt-4 sm:mt-8">
        <li>to promote and preserve <i>co-operative</i> and common ownership in Stirchley;</li>
        <li>to build affordable housing and premises for <i>co-operative</i> businesses in an environmentally sustainable way; and</li>
        <li>to contribute to the regeneration of Stirchley for the benefit of the whole community.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We use the Somerset Rules for <i>Co-operative</i> Societies.</p>
      <p class="tracking-wide text-xs text-grey-darker border-t pt-2 sm:text-sm">Stirchley <i>Co-operative</i> Development Ltd. is company number RS004496. As a company registered under the <i>Co-operative</i> and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014, the co-op is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). </p>

      <h1 class="">What is a <i>Co-operative</i>?</h1>
      <img src="img/coop-marque.png" class="" />
      <p class="text-xs leading-tight sm:text-base"><em>This content is part of the <i>Co-operative</i> Identity, as defined by the International <i>Co-operative</i> Alliance.</em></p>
      <blockquote>A <i>co-operative</i> is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their  common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically controlled enterprise.</blockquote>
      <p><i>Co-operatives</i> are people-centred enterprises owned and run by and for their members to realise their common dreams. Profits generated are either reinvested in the enterprise or returned to the members.</p>
      <p><i>Co-operatives</i> bring people together in a democratic and equal way. Whether the members are the customers, employees, users or residents, <i>co-operatives</i> are democratically managed by the 'one member, one vote' rule. Members share equal voting rights regardless of the amount of capital they put into the enterprise. They allow people to take control of their economic future and, because they are not owned by shareholders, the economic and social benefits of their activity stay in the communities where they are established.</p>
      <p>As businesses driven by values not just profit, <i>co-operatives</i> share internationally agreed principles and act together to build a better world through <i>co-operation</i>. Putting fairness and equality at the heart of the enterprise, <i>co-operatives</i> around the world are allowing people to work together to create sustainable enterprises that generate long-term jobs and prosperity.</p>
      <p><i>Co-operative</i> economic development, characterised by the search for means of production and efficient exchanges based on <i>co-operation</i>, is there to improve peopleâ€™s lives and look after the environment. This is far for being a marginal phenomenon, one in every six people on the planet are <i>co-operators</i>.</p>
      <h2>Values</h2>
      <p><i>Co-operatives</i> are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity. In the tradition of their founders, <i>co-operative</i> members believe in the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others.</p>
      <h2>Principles</h2>
      <p>The <i>co-operative</i> principles are guidelines by which <i>co-operatives</i> put their values into practice.</p>
      <h3>1. Voluntary and Open Membership</h3>
      <p><i>Co-operatives</i> are voluntary organisations, open to all persons able to use their services and willing to accept the responsibilities of membership, without gender, social, racial, political or religious discrimination.</p>
      <h3>2. Democratic Member Control</h3>
      <p><i>Co-operatives</i> are democratic organisations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary <i>co-operatives</i> members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and <i>co-operatives</i> at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.</p>
      <h3>3. Member Economic Participation</h3>
      <p>Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their <i>co-operative</i>. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the <i>co-operative</i>. Members usually receive limited compensation, if any, on capital subscribed as a condition of membership. Members allocate surpluses for any or all of the following purposes: developing their <i>co-operative</i>, possibly by setting up reserves, part of which at least would be indivisible; benefiting members in proportion to their transactions with the <i>co-operative</i>; and supporting other activities approved by the membership.</p>
      <h3>4. Autonomy and Independence</h3>
      <p><i>Co-operatives</i> are autonomous, self-help organisations controlled by their members. If they enter into agreements with other organisations, including governments, or raise capital from external sources, they do so on terms that ensure democratic control by their members and maintain their <i>co-operative</i> autonomy.</p>
      <h3>5. Education, Training and Information</h3>
      <p><i>Co-operatives</i> provide education and training for their members, elected representatives, managers, and employees so they can contribute effectively to the development of their <i>co-operatives</i>. They inform the general public - particularly young people and opinion leaders - about the nature and benefits of co-operation.</p>
      <h3>6. Cooperation among <i>Co-operatives</i></h3>
      <p><i>Co-operatives</i> serve their members most effectively and strengthen the <i>co-operative</i> movement by working together through local, national, regional and international structures.</p>
      <h3>7. Concern for Community</h3>
      <p><i>Co-operatives</i> work for the sustainable development of their communities through policies approved by their members.</p>

      <h1 class="">What's happening in Stirchley?</h1>
      <img src="img/bowling-alley.jpg" class="" />
      <p>Since the financial crisis, house prices and land prices have increased significantly, whilst wages have stagnated and people are leading ever more precarious lives. The many empty shop fronts that appeared on our high street after 2008 have meant that Stirchley had become less lively and was unable to be a local place to meet and shop. Stirchley is now being labelled as an 'up-and-coming' area of Birmingham, with people moving in from around the city, attracted by a high street which has seen a revival in recent years.</p>
      <p>However, we are concerned that local people and businesses are beginning to be 'priced out' of Stirchley. Vital local services are under ever more pressure due to austerity. We want to offer something positive to the community we love. Our members have been part of a number of <i>co-operative</i> ventures which have been established to provide important products and services to the community, stable, work with training and development opportunities decided by ourselves, and affordable housing.</p>
      <p>We hope that Stirchley <i>Co-operative</i> Development Limited can offer some <i>co-operative</i> spirit and inclusive, community-focused values to improve the area for ourselves and more broadly for the people of Stirchley.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="tab-content" id="plans">
      <h1>What are our plans?</h1>
      <img src="img/stirchley-sign.jpg" class="" />
      <p>For the last two years we have been trying to work out how to do something amazing in Stirchley. Working with valuable partners and community members who have worked together on multiple projects, we aim to develop a mixed-use residential and retail development around Stirchley High Street on the A441 Pershore Road. Retail space for local worker co-ops, <i>co-operative</i> housing, an events space and maybe even childcare will all be created at a price which is realistic for its current and future members. We are working with a housing association which is experienced in ecological and cost-conscious design-and-build of <i>co-operative</i> housing.</p>
      <p>We hope that whatever Stirchley Co-operative Development creates will be a long-term asset, enabling regeneration of an area we care about in a way that is sensitive to the past and ambitious about our common future.</p>
      <p>We are not currently looking for members during this development phase. However, if we are successful in our endeavour, we will be opening applications for people to join and make their home here. We are looking to finance this project using a variety of sources. We will conduct a 'community share issue' in order to allow people to invest in this <i>co-operative</i> and have a say in how it's run.</p>
