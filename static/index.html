<p>
  Stirchley Co-operative Development (SCD) is a group of local housing and worker co-operatives who are building an affordable and eco-friendly residential and retail premises in the heart of Stirchley. We will be developing land on Pershore Road to house three local businesses along with 45 apartments.
</p>

<h2>
  Where? 
</h2>

<p>
  We are purchasing the derelict land on the corner of Hunts Road and Pershore Road to the right of the British Oak pub. 
</p>

<h2>
  Who is involved? 
</h2>

<p>
  SCD has been developed over the last decade by local workers co-operatives <strong>Birmingham Bike Foundry</strong>, <strong>Loaf Bakery & Cookery School</strong> and <strong>Artefact Projects</strong> along with local housing co-operatives, <strong>Federici</strong> and <strong>Gung Ho</strong>. We are working with <a href="https://accordgroup.org.uk/">Accord</a>, a housing association with a track record of building cost-conscious ecological co-operative housing. 
</p>

<p>
  We are buying the land outright from Seven Capital and will not be part of their development around Hazelwell Lane. 
</p>

<p>
  While we are a co-op, we are not affiliated with "The Co-op" supermarket chain. 
</p>

<h2>
  How will it be managed?
</h2>

<p>
  The building will be owned by SCD whose membership is comprised of and restricted to the residents and businesses occupying it. 
</p>

<p>
  The building will be run on Somerset Rules for Co-operative Societies with a constitution agreed to by all members. Regular meetings with votes fairly distributed will decide on issues as they arise. 
</p>

<p>
  Effectively, once the mortgage is paid, the building is owned and run by the tenants, for as long as they remain tenants. 
</p>

<h2>
  Where's the money coming from?
</h2>

<p>
  Roughly half of the building costs will come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homes_England">Homes England</a>, the government body that funds the development of affordable social housing. The other half will be a mortgage from an ethical bank or building society. Rents will cover the mortgage, maintenance and management costs. 
</p>

<h2>
  What is "affordable" and how is that achieved?
</h2>
<p>
  "Affordable Housing" is an official term for housing that meets certain criteria such as charging rents below market rates. We are registered with Homes England as a provider of affordable housing and will have to abide by these criteria. 
</p>
<p>
  In addition: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Accord, our partner, specialise in affordable housing, both in the construction and running of the building. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Energy efficiency, from insulation to solar panels, will keep running costs down. 
  </li>
  <li>
    In the event of SCD generating a surplus, any profits will be reinvested in the building, increasing efficiency and reducing costs. 
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Can anyone live there? 
</h2>

<p>
  There will be criteria for living at SCD, the main one being you must be in need of housing (ie, not be a home-owner) and agree to the mutually agreed rules of the co-operative. Within reason, we will prioritise people already living in the local area in need of decent affordable housing. 
</p>

<p>
  Anyone can apply to live in the housing provided by SCD and there will be an application process for any prospective tenants. Anyone who becomes a tenant also becomes a member of the co-operative and has democratic input (via voting) into the management of the building. There is an understanding that members should contribute a small amount of time to the overall running and management of the project. 
</p>

<p>
  As a registered provider of affordable housing we will be accepting applications from the Birmingham council waiting list. 
</p>

<p>
  We will be providing a number of wheelchair accessible flats and hope to take into consideration people with a variety of access needs. We will also be child and family friendly. 
</p>

<p>
  Community cohesion is important to us and we will encourage members new to the area to get involved in the many groups in Stirchley. 
</p>


<h2>
  What businesses will be operating from the ground floor? 
</h2>

<p>
  The ground floor of the building is being designed around the needs of the three founder workers co-ops, allowing for changes of occupancy over the 50 years of the building's minimum lifespan. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Birmingham Bike Foundry is a cycle repair shop. It will house a workshop and retail areas. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Loaf is a bakery and cookery school with a kitchen, shop and classroom. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Artefact Projects is an art space housing exhibitions, performances and a cafe/bar. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All three will see their space and activities expanding significantly. In the event of a founder business leaving, future occupant businesses must be constituted as a workers co-operative.
</p>

<p>
  SCD itself aims to establish a "centre of excellence" for co-operative businesses in the region, encouraging more workers co-operatives in Stirchley by offering advice and support. In the long term we are interested in undertaking further developments in the local area, particularly in housing.
</p>

<h2>
  How will this benefit Stirchley? 
</h2>

<p>
  We see benefits coming in a range of ways. 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Our building will be a long-term asset contributing to the regeneration of the area, sensitive to the past and ambitious about Stirchleyâ€™s common future.
  </li>
  <li>
    We offer a sustainable alternative to private rental, tackling local housing issues by providing affordable accommodation and work space under common ownership.
  </li>
  <li>
    Over the last decade we have helped drive locally led development in Stirchley, creating a commercial environment and customer base for new businesses to establish on the high street while respecting the history and heritage of Stirchley. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Stirchley has a 150 year history of co-operative organisations, from TASCOs to the present day. We aim to create a "centre of excellence" for co-operatives in the Midlands assisting new and established organisations to adopt a sustainable co-operative model.
  </li>
  <li>
    With the exception of disabled drivers, we will operate a no-car-ownership policy, encouraging cycling, public transport and car-sharing, helping to normalise car-free living in Birmingham and reduce congestion. 
  </li>
  <li>
    The building will be as environmentally conscious as possible within the constraints of the budget. Ancillary plans include community composting, a kitchen garden and roof-top bee-hives. 
  </li>
</ul>
