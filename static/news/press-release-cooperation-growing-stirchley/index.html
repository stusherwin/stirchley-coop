      <h2>
        Co-operation is growing in Stirchley
      </h2>
<p>
  Affordable housing and retail spaces to add social and economic value to the community
</p>

<p>
  The Birmingham suburb of Stirchley has a 150 year history of co-operative organisations run for the community, by the community. A major new venture revives this spirit for the 21st Century.
</p>

      <p>
        Following three years of planning and research, Stirchley Co-operative Development Ltd. (SCD) have agreed to purchase outright land on Hunts Road and Pershore Road, adjacent to the British Oak pub, from developers Seven Capital.
      </p>

<p>
  SCD is working toward the construction of a new residential and retail site with space for worker co-operatives and affordable housing in the heart of Stirchley. In partnership with Accord, a housing association with a great track record of building cost-conscious and ecological housing, SCD are developing plans for the site to include new retail premises for established worker co-operatives; Loaf Bakery & Cookery School, Birmingham Bike Foundry and Artefact Projects, and 45 affordable housing units to accommodate individuals, couples and families. The building will be constructed using sustainable and cost-efficient production techniques creating a functional new space that will be a positive addition to the Pershore Road. 
</p>

<p>
  The SCD building will be a long-term asset contributing to the regeneration of the area. Run with high levels of community involvement and reduced negative environmental impacts, it aims to be sensitive to the past and ambitious about Stirchleyâ€™s common future. Offering a sustainable alternative to private rental, this extensive project will help to tackle local social housing issues by providing accommodation and work space under common ownership.
</p>

<p>
  Construction is set to begin in May 2020 and is scheduled to last two years. During the construction stage the application process will open for those who wish to make their new home in Stirchley as part of the co-operative. 
</p>

<p>
  Stirchley Co-operative Development is supported by local businesses and its founding members are all current Stirchley or Selly Park residents. The organisation is incorporated as a business using the Somerset Rules for Co-operative Societies and has been awarded substantial financial support from Homes England.
